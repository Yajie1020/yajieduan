##  Advisor: [Professor Guoliang Tian](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/tiangl/en/), Southern University of Science and Technology

*	Conducted likelihood ratio tests, score tests, and Wald tests, for the homogeneity of two ZOIP populations
*	Estimated unknown parameters within the test statistics by EM algorithm and its extension
*	Conducted simulation studies to compare the proposed tests by checking error rate and power for different sample sizes; illustrated with three real data sets
