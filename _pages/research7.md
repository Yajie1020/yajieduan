* Proposed novel estimation methods for particle count in a solution by dilution series data from experiments, based on censored Binomial and Poisson distributions
* Conducted simulation studies that showed good performance of the proposed methodology to estimate the concentration of particles in neat samples
* Built a package in R to implement proposed method to perform an automatic particle assay with count estimates
* Developing Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate posterior distributions of particle counts
* Developing a novel and efficient experimental design for serial dilution assays
