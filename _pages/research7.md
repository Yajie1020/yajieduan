* Proposed a novel phage plaque count estimation method by dilution series data of a virus stock based on censored Binomial and Poisson distributions
* Conducted simulation studies that showed good performance of the proposed methodology to estimate the original concentration of phages
* Built a package in R and a web application to implement proposed method and perform an automatic plaque assay
