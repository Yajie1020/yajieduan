* Proposed novel estimation methods for particle count by dilution series data of a solution stock based on censored Binomial and Poisson distributions
* Conducted simulation studies that showed good performance of the proposed methodology to estimate the original concentration of particles
* Built a package in R and a web application to implement proposed method and perform an automatic particle assay
