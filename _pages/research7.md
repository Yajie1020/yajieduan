* Proposed novel estimation methods for particle concentration in a solution by dilution series data based on censored Binomial and Poisson distributions
* Conducted simulation studies that showed good performance of the proposed methodology to estimate the original concentration of particles
* Built a package in R and a web application to implement the proposed method and perform an automatic particle assay
