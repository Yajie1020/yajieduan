## Advisor: [Professor Javier Cabrera](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/people-pages/faculty/people/130-faculty/370-javier-cabrera), Rutgers University

* Proposed new [Projection Pursuit (PP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_pursuit) indices that can be used for extremely large multi-dimensional data sets, using a data compression method called “data nuggets” that reduces a large dataset into a smaller collection of data nuggets that maintain the data structure. They are used to find interesting hidden sturctures such as clusters, outliers and other linear and non-linear structrues.
* Developed static and dynamic graphical tools using proposed PP indices to visualize large multivariate data.
* Implemented guided tours to generate interactive and efficient visualization for bigdata and detect data structures
* Built packages in R and Python to implement proposed data visualization and analysis method for large multivariate data sets.
