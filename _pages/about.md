Hi! I am Yajie Duan, a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics, Rutgers Univerisy](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/). I am doing research works about [Projection Pursuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_pursuit) in big data, statistical modeling and biostatistical methods under the guidance of [Professor Javier Cabrera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oiy2ruwAAAAJ&hl=en). I also did some research on Bayesian models and biostatistical modeling in the [Collaborative Center for Statistics in Science, Yale University](https://ysph.yale.edu/c2s2/) advised by [Professor Heping Zhang](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/heping_zhang/) in 2018. 

Now my main research project about Projection Pursuit in big data focuses on the visualization and analysis of extremely large multivariate datasets. A novel Projection Pursuit methodology for large multi-dimensional datasets with new static and dynamic graphic tools are being developed to help find interesting hidden structures. It would an important step in big-data analysis and visualization domain, and enable better understanding of multi-dimensional big data to help with modeling and decision making.

Before coming to Rutgers, I earned my BSc degree from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in Shenzhen, China. I did some reasearch about hypothesis testing for homogeneity of two zero-and-one-inflated poisson populations, and a new multivariate [asymmetric Laplace distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_Laplace_distribution) based on mixture of normals, guided by [Professor Guoliang Tian](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/teacher/TIAN,Guoliang?lang=en-us) in the Department of Statistics and Data Science.
