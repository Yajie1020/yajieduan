## Advisor: [Professor Heping Zhang](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/heping_zhang/), Yale University

*	Built Bayesian models via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate probability distributions of the chances of live birth, conception, and pregnancy; chose the best prior distributions based on convergence characteristics and posterior prediction performance 
*	Developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for 3-D brain-imaging data via R to locate sub-regions of the brain that are associated with clinical outcomes 
*	Created a web calculator, [Prediction Calculator for Pregnancy Outcomes - Yale C2S2](https://pregnancyprediction.medicine.yale.edu/), as part of the paper <var>A personalized medicine approach to Ovulation Induction/Ovarian Stimulation: Development of a predictive model and online calculator from level-I evidence, Fertility and Sterility, 117(2), pp.408-418.</var>
