## Advisor: [Professor Javier Cabrera](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/people-pages/faculty/people/130-faculty/370-javier-cabrera),  Rutgers University

*	Developed a new methodology considering time lags to forecast both confirmed COVID-19 daily cases and deaths with confidence and prediction intervals, using LSTM models and reinforcement learning models
* Proposed pre-processing techniques for COVID-19 data, including modified versions of variance stabilizing transformations and smoothing splines to deal with data irregularities and inconsistency 
*	Illustrated using New Jersey COVID-19 data with a good prediction performance
