* Built an efficent deep learning algorithm to generate novel and realistic protein loop backbone structures based on a database of structurally homologous loops for HCV protease
*	Specifically, built a new sequence-to-sequence Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with bidirectional Long short-term memory (LSTM) models to generate novel protein loops with various lengths
*	Implemented in PyTorch via Python and evaluate the viability and novelty of the generated protein loop structures
