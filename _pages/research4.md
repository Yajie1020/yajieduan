## Advisor: [Guoliang Tian](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/tiangl/en/)

*	Proposed a new shifted multivariate asymmetric Laplace distribution based on normal variance mixture model
*	Derived the probability density function and other statistical properties using stochastic representation; conducted various methods of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing of independence among components
*	Conducted simulation studies to evaluate proposed distribution and methods; illustrated with two real datasets
