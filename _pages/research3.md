## Advisor: [Professor Javier Cabrera](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/people-pages/faculty/people/130-faculty/370-javier-cabrera), [Cardiovascular Institute of New Jersey](https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/institutes/cvinj/overview), Rutgers University

* Proposed a novel two-stage Deming regression model that combines an arbitrary prediction model and Deming regression model. 
* Developed an assessment system for the risks of stroke vs. bleeding taking patient’s personal fears of outcomes into account, with the proposed two-stage regression model.
* Implemented an algorithm that produces a graph with two regions corresponding to whether the patient should take anticoagulants based on the predicted risks of stroke and bleeding and the patient’s fears of bleeding
* Built an R Shiny app for physicians to help prescribe anticoagulants based on the proposed methodology
* Developing generalized two-stage Deming regression models that could be used for statistical analysis with privacy-protected data, and deal with uncertainty from data error and privacy protections
